# Processor_Design
Designed and Built a fully functioning single and pipelined processors in Verilog

## Assembler
- Generate mif file using assembly file as an input file.
- python Assembler.py < input Assembly file > < Name of Ouput File >

## Single Cycle Processor
- A simple single processor that can support a specific ISA.
- Any logic optimization is not implemented (Since this is just a single cycle processor

## Pipelined Processor
- Buit on the Single Cycle Processor
- Added five stages that are fetch, decode, execute, memory, and writeback
